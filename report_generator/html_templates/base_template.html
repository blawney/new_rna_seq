<h3>Read-alignment</h3>
Read alignment to the #ASSEMBLY# reference genome/transcriptome was performed with #ALIGNER# (<a href="#ALIGNER_REF_URL#">#ALIGNER_REF_URL#</a>).
</div>

									<h3>FASTQ Files</h3>
									These are raw sequence files converted to base-calls by the sequencer software.  More information about 
FASTQ format: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format</a>  
								</div>
								<div>
									<h3>BAM files</h3>
									These are binary versions of <b>S</b>equence <b>A</b>lignment <b>M</b>ap (SAM) formatted files, which 
are produced as output from the alignment software.  Information about the format <a href="http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf" >here (PDF)</a>.  These are suitable 
for loading into the Broad Institute's <a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/">IGV genome browser</a> (note that BAM index files will need to be created to use these 
files with IGV).
								</div>
<div>
<h3>Read-counts</h3>
	Sequencing reads aligning to unique exons are summed within each gene locus.  Counting is performed by featureCounts software (<a 
href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/7/923.full.pdf">http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/7/923.full.pdf</a>).  Reads located in 
regions 
where 
genomic features overlap are ignored since they cannot be 
definitively assigned to a single transcript.

									<h3>RNA-Seq QC report</h3>
									RNA-Seq quality metrics are produced by the Broad Institute's <a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/rna-seqc" target="_blank">RNA-SeQC</a> tool.

		Calculation of normalized counts
	</h3>
	Read-count normalization is performed by DESeq software (<a href="http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/10/R106/">http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/10/R106/</a>). This 
attempts to control biases in the 
read counts due to input library size via a robust median-based calculation.  
Assuming that most genes are not differentially expressed, consistent differences in counts between samples provides a method of assessing the relative size of the input 
libraries.  
	Further details of the normalization procedure may be found in the DESeq publication referenced above.

	<h3>
		DESeq Analysis
	</h3>

	Differential expression analysis was performed with the DESeq tool, provided as part of R's Bioconductor package.  
	More detailed information can be found in the <a href="http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/10/r106" target="_blank">original DESeq publication</a>.  
	In short, the analysis steps consist of: 
	<ul>
	<li>Count normalization.  By examining the counts of all genes across all samples, the software attempts to normalize for differences due to input library size.
	An inherent assumption of this step is that <i>most</i> genes in a series of contrasts are not differentially expressed.  The normalized read counts for a particular 
	sample are based on the median across all genes; this attempts to minimize the effect of highly expressed transcripts on the normalization procedure.</li>
	<li>Using a negative binomial model to approximate the distribution of the read counts, a mean-dispersion relationship is determined from a local regression using a 
generalized
	linear model of the gamma family.</li>
	<li>For each gene, determine the probability of the observed counts under the null hypothesis that the counts in each condition are the same.  The raw P-values are 
	adjusted using the standard Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction to control the false-discovery rate (FDR).  These values are also commonly called "q-values". 
</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA)</h3>
Gene-set enrichment analysis uses the normalized gene-level read-counts as a proxy for the relative expression of each gene.  Using gene sets curated from databases of canonical 
pathways, the software tests if genes in particular pathways display consistent and significantly different expression between the contrasted biological states.  More 
information about the method and software is available at <a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp">http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp</a>.

	<h3>
		Heatmaps
	</h3>
	Heatmaps were prepared on a contrast-level basis.  For each contrast, we take the most highly expressed genes as determined by their mean across all samples.  As this 
report
	is prepared as an initial inspection of the data, these images may not be appropriate for every study.  Further, specific analysis can be arranged with the assistance of 
the CCCB.
